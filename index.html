            <h2 class="bio">Short Intro</h2>
            <p class="bio">I live in Denver, CO, and am learning to code while working full time! With that alone, my schedule is pretty busy. When I have spare time, I love getting out to the mountains and hiking. I miss being able to walk everyday, but am trying to fit in workouts to remain active. I really value time with my family and close friends. Gameboard nights, nights in with a book, and watching old movies or Project Runway/reality romance shows are a favorite past time of mine. Time to myself isn't horrible, so quarantine hasn't been too bad, but I'm also glad technology has brought us to a place that I can keep in touch with my friends. I also adopted the poster child for cat obesity, Harold, and he helps a lot.</p>
